# Quick Lists  

Despite the todo app being a very unoriginal project, I wanted to create my own personalised version of a todo app.
I've found it to be a useful side project that I can add to over time as I learn what works for me personally in terms of productivity and staying organised.

All lists are stored in local storage. As I said, this is a personal project customised to what works for me and I haven't designed it with anything else in mind. Therefore it's currently a little buggy, but that's okay because I'm the only person using it. I do intend to fix accessibility issues, add some fun colour themes and art, and add other functionality in the future.
