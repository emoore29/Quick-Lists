# Quick Lists  

* This is intended to help users quickly organise their ideas and tasks in lists. 
* Built using Vite, React, and Tailwind. 
* All lists are stored in local storage.
* I used this project to explore the HTML data- attribute, using it to create colour themes. I'd like to add new themes in the future.
